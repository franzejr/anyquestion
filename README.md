# anyquestion

This is a web app for managing the step "Do you have any question?" that happens at the end of a talk. It's inspired by a feature present in [Daskit](https://www.daskit.com/). Every talk has a room, people ask questions there and vote on other people questions. Then it gets easy for the speaker to select the question with the more weight.
